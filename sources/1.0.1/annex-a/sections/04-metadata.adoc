== Metadata Features

[[sec_4.1]]
=== Introduction

The maximum use must be made of meta features to reduce the attribution
on individual features. Some meta features are mandatory in a dataset;
see S-127 Product Specification main document clauses 10.9 and 10.11.

[[sec_4.2]]
=== Mandatory meta features

The mandatory meta features are given in the following list:

*Data Coverage*

*Quality of non-Bathymetric Data*

[[sec_4.3]]
=== Data coverage meta feature

*Data Coverage*: In order to assist in data discovery, the meta feature
*Data Coverage* must be used to provide the area of coverage of the
S-127 dataset. This means that *Data Coverage* expresses where the
presence or absence of S-127 geographic features is asserted. Unlike
S-101 datasets, there is no 'skin of the earth' principle in S-127
and there may be regions covered by a *Data Coverage* but where no
geographic S-127 feature is present.

There are no associations for *Data Coverage* features.

7+a| [underline]#INT 1 Reference:#

The meta feature *Data Coverage* encodes the area covered by the dataset.
This feature is also used to provide the ECDIS with the scale information
necessary for the determination of dataset loading and unloading in
relation to the user selected viewing scale in the ECDIS. There must
be a minimum of one *Data Coverage* feature in a dataset. *Data Coverage*
features must cover at least the extent of the spatial types in the
dataset, and must not overlap.

The use of S-127 data is scale-independent (see <<sec_2.8>>) and minimum
display scale will normally be (null) and maximum display scale 1000
(the extreme values in the table of scales in the S-101 ENC,
see <<table_2-11>>). Should a producer need to encode different maximum
and minimum display scales from the extreme (i.e., create scale-dependent
datasets), the values of maximum and minimum display scales should
be harmonized with base layer S-101 datasets (see the S-101 DCEG clause
3.4.1).

Given that S-127 data will overlay ENC and possibly other datasets,
the conditions described in S-101 clause 3.4.1 for displaying overscale
warnings and setting the viewing scale may be overridden by interoperability
constraints or the presence of higher-priority datasets. The specification
of such behaviour is out of scope for this document (the S-100 interoperability
specification should address it for ECDIS).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* This meta feature is intended to support an indication of coverage.
* Where a dataset consists of only one Data Coverage feature, the
value for the maximum display scale populated in the dataset discovery
metadata must be the same as the value populated for maximum display
scale on the Data Coverage.
* For any *Data Coverage* feature, maximum display scale < minimum
display scale.

[underline]#INT 1 Reference:# Quality of positions

The meta feature *Quality of Non-bathymetric Data* may be used to
provide an indication of the overall uncertainty of position for all
non-bathymetric features. It must not be used to provide the uncertainty
of bathymetric information.

The attribute *horizontal position uncertainty* may be applied to
any spatial type, in order to qualify the location of a feature.

*Horizontal distance uncertainty* and *horizontal position uncertainty*
must not be applied to the spatial type of any geo feature if they
are identical to the *horizontal distance uncertainty* and
*position uncertainty* values of the underlying meta feature.

*Position uncertainty* on the *Quality of Non-bathymetric Data* applies
to non-bathymetric data situated within the area, while
*position uncertainty* on the associated spatial types qualifies the
location of the *Quality of Non-bathymetric Data* feature itself.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* No remarks.

[underline]#Distinction:# [None].
