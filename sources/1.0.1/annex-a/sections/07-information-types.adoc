8+| INT 1 Reference:

Where a complex attribute has all its sub-attributes optional
(e.g., multiplicity 0..1 or 0..*), at least one of the sub-attributes
must be populated.

The *featureName* attribute of an instance of an information type
can be used for a short title that is either a proper name
(if such is relevant) or which describes the instance. For example,
the *featureName* attribute of an *Authority* information type can
be the name of a government agency.*featureName* attributes of information
types should not duplicate the geographic feature name of an associated
feature, but should pertain to the information instance itself.
The *featureName* attribute should be populated only if the value
conveys useful information to the end user. Some examples of such
situations are:

* providing the name of an organisation, such as the name of an Authority.
* distinguishing between instances -- if multiple instances of the
same information type are associated to the same feature type
(or another information type), the different instances may be given
descriptive names to make it easier for the mariner to distinguish
their content.
Some information instances are associated to multiple features, in
which case its name should be general enough to be relevant to all
the features.

For example, if naming *Regulations* instances describing fishing
regulations for protected areas, consider whether (for example) there
is a general regulation applicable to all protected areas in a jurisdiction
and an exceptional regulations object associated to a single area
or a subset of areas in the jurisdiction. In this situation, the general
regulations may be encoded with the name "General fishing regulations
for Marine Conservation Areas" and associated to several MPA features,
while a specific MPA feature can also have a specific regulation whose
name is "Special fishing regulations for (named area)".

The *featureName* attribute in complex attribute *sourceIndication*
is intended for the name of the source.

The *AdditionalInformation* association to a *NauticalInfomation*
object can be used to attach an additional chunk of information to
an information type, and there is no applicable specific information
type or association. This should be used sparingly if at all.

[[sec_7.2.1]]
==== Abstract supertype for information from textual sources

*AbstractRxN* is the supertype of the four types intended primarily
for encoding information from regulatory or other text sources.
The attributes *categoryOfRxN* and *actionOrActivity* should be encoded
wherever possible in order to allow software to classify the content
according to the type of regulation (*categoryOfRxN*) and its effects
on common maritime activities by both commercial and recreational
vessels.

At least one of the attributes *textContent* and *graphic* must be
populated.

Subtypes of *AbstractRxN* must not be associated to *Nautical Information*,
since this leads to chains of information types which have little
or no meaning in reality.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Association _AssociatedRxN_ is with a geographic feature. While
an association from geographic feature to information type can be
encoded in the geographic feature instance, the reverse association
from the information type to the geographic feature may be omitted
from the information type instance or encoded using the generic inverse
association _invInformationAssociation_ instead of the named role.

Nautical information is intended for material that is largely informative
in nature, of which does not fit into the category of regulation,
recommendation, or restriction.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Association _AdditionalInformation_ may be with a geographic feature
or an information type. Association _AssociatedRxN_ is with a geographic
feature. While an association from geographic feature to information
type can be encoded in the geographic feature instance, the reverse
association from the information type to the geographic feature may
be omitted from the information type instance or encoded using the
generic inverse association _invInformationAssociation_ instead of
the named role.
* In theory, *Nautical Information* can be associated with any geographic
feature through either an _AdditionalInformation_ or _AssociatedRxN_
association. _AdditionalInformation_ should be used only when the
information encoded in *Nautical Information* is general in nature
and does not supplement information encoded in a *Regulations*, *Restrictions*,
or *Recommendations* object associated to the same feature.
* According to a purely theoretical reading of the model,
*Nautical Information* can be associated to another *Nautical Information*,
*Regulations*, *Restrictions*, or *Recommendations* instance using
the _AdditionalInformation_ association inherited from
*Information Type*. This is not permitted due to the undefined semantics
of chaining RxN types (i.e., such chaining has little or no significant
meaning and has not been given any special meaning in the model).

--
BALAST: The vessel is ballasted as described by this attribute.

VSLMSM: The vessel or cargo matches the attribute value (for multi-valued
attributes, matches at least one of the values).

ICECAP, UKCLRN, PRFMNC attributes: The vessel matches the specified
requirement. Absent attributes or null values are ignored.

LOGCON states whether "all" or "at least one" of the specifications
must be met.

CATREL indicates the relationship between matching vessels and the
associated information object or feature.

With one instance of APPLIC:

VSLMSM [VSLCAR=length, VSLUNT=metre, COMPOP=greater than, VSLVAL=50],
CATVSL=3 (tanker), LOGCON=1 (and), CATREL=5 (required); associated
to a PILBOP object: tankers with LOA > 50.0 m must use the PILBOP

PRFMNC="Vessels with thrusters", MBRSHP=2; associated to a REGLTS
object: Vessels with thrusters are exempted from the regulation.

If VSLMSM becomes repeatable:

VSLMSM [VSLCAR=length, VSLUNT=metre, COMPOP=(>), VSLVAL=50], VSLMSM
[VSLCAR=length, VSLUNT=metre, COMPOP=(<), VSLVAL=90], CATDHC=19, LOGCON=1
(and), MBRSHP=1 (included);

associated with *Regulations*: the regulation applies to vessels with
LOA greater than 50.0 and less than 90.0 m. carrying MARPOL Class
8 corrosive substances.

Same situation as above with one instance of VSLMSM:

VSLMSM [[VSLCAR=length; VSLUNT=metre, VSLVAL=50; COMPOP=(>)],[VSLCAR=length;
VSLUNT=metre, VSLVAL=90; COMPOP=(<)]], CATVSL=3 (tanker), LOGCON=1

associated with a REGLTS: the regulation applies to vessels with LOA
greater than 50.0 and less than 90.0 m. carrying MARPOL Class 8 corrosive
substances.

* Multiple values of *Category of Cargo* and of
*Category of Dangerous Or Hazardous Cargo* should be treated as

vessels with either bulk or container cargo or both).
