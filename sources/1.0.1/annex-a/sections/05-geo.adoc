[[sec_5.2.1]]
==== Caution areas (see S-4 -- B-242)

If it is required to identify an area in which the mariner must be
aware of circumstances influencing the safety of navigation (for example
an area of continually changing depths), and which cannot be encoded
using other feature types, it must be done using the feature
*Caution Area*. This feature may be required to identify a danger,
a risk, a rule or advice that is not directly related to a particular
feature.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* To encode the relevant cautionary information, an instance of the
information type *Nautical Information* (see <<sec_7.3>>) must be
associated to the *Caution Area*.
* If the information applies to a specific area the *Caution Area*
feature should cover only that area.
* If the information to be encoded is spatially linear, this should
be encoded using a "very narrow" *Caution Area* feature of type area
(approximately 0&#xB7;2mm wide at the maximum display scale of the ENC
data) similar to the method for encoding linear maritime jurisdiction
areas (see <<IHO_S_101,clause=2.5.10>>).
* Information which may be of use to the mariner, but is not significant
to safe navigation and cannot be encoded using other feature types,
should be encoded using a differentfeature type and an associated
instance of the information type *Nautical Information* (see <<sec_7.3>>),
complex attribute *information* (see <<sec_8.8>>). This encoding is
intended to reduce the number of alarms or indications generated in
the ECDIS due to the overuse of *Caution Area* features.
* Notes should be kept to a minimum and be as concise as is compatible
with accuracy and intelligibility. Hydrographic terminology (jargon)
should be avoided, giving preference to easily understood words, for
example "depths" rather than "bathymetry".
* In order to ensure correct ECDIS display, *Caution Area* features
of type surface should not share the geometry of features such as
*Depth Contour* (S-101) and other features with higher ECDIS display
priorities, as the *Caution Area* will appear to be "open ended",
which may confuse the mariner. Where this occurs, the edge of the
*Caution Area* should be extended outward to clear the "shared" edge,
sufficient to avoid "duplicate geometry" validation errors (that is,
at least 0.3 mm at the maximum display scale for the ENC data).

==== Radio calling-in (reporting) points (see S-4 -- B-488.1 and B-488.2)

Radio reporting points, also called radio calling-in points, have
been established in certain busy waterways and port approaches to
assist traffic control. On passing these points or crossing a defined
line, vessels are required to report on VHF to a Traffic Control Centre.

If it is required to encode a radio reporting point or line, it must
be done using the feature *Radio Calling-in Point*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Each *Radio Calling-In Point* feature of type point must carry at
least one orientation. If it is required to encode the reciprocal
orientation, to indicate that a bearing and its opposite apply to
a *Radio Calling-In Point* feature, it must be done using attribute
*trafficFlow* = _4_ (two-way). If the same position is used for another
orientation (not opposite) of traffic flow, a second *orientationValue*
attribute must be encoded.
* The complex attribute *featureName*, sub-attribute *name* is used
to encode the name and/or alphanumeric designator of the
*Radio Calling-In Point*.
* Regulations, restrictions, and recommendations are encoded using
one or more instances of the information classes *Regulations*, *Restrictions*,
or *Recommendations*. For example, if the requirement to report by
radio relates to certain classes of vessels only.
* An associated instance of the information class *Nautical Information*
(see <<sec_7.3>>), complex attribute*information* isused to provide
additional information, when *Regulations*, *Restrictions*, or *Recommendations*
are not appropriate
* *Radio Calling-In Point* features of type curve must be encoded
such that resultant direction of the line (accounting for the direction
of digitising and any subsequent reversal of the curve) is related
such that the direction of traffic that is required to report is to
the right. For curve features, it is not required to populate *orientation*.
* If it is required to encode the area of a Vessel Traffic Service
(VTS) containing radio reporting points or requiring periodic position
reporting, this should be done using the feature
*Vessel Traffic Service Area* (see <<sec_5.24>>).
* Each VHF-channel should be indicated, using the attribute
*communicationChannel* (see Appendix C-1).
* If it is required to encode the cargo of a vessel required to report
when passing the radio calling-in point, this must be done using the
*categoryOfCargo* attribute.
* If it is required to encode a specific type of vessel that is required
to report when passing the radio calling-in point, this must be done
using the *categoryOfVessel* attribute.

ships may be disembarked at a different location. Pilots may board
from a helicopter; it is then less important for a ship to reach the
exact position of the boarding place but an approximate position should
still be encoded. Some pilot stations are used solely for long-distance
(deep-sea) pilots. Pilots may be in constant attendance, in regular
attendance at certain limited times, or available by previous arrangement
only. The primary purpose of encoded pilotage information is to show
the position of the facility. Because of the many variations in the

be in an associated publication or product.

If it is required to encode a pilot boarding place, it must be done

==== Routeing Measure (see S-4 -- B-432 - 436)

The *Routeing Measure* feature is a simplification of the tracks and
routes features in the ENC. A *Routeing Measure* feature is created
by combining the spatial extents of the tracks and routes feature
instances which together make up a specific track or route. The purpose
of this feature in S-127 is to provide an indication of the existence
of a route or track, as well as physical locations to which specific
information can be associated in the form of information types.
In S-127, each *Routeing Measure* feature has only a category attribute
that indicates the type of track or route.

The table below indicates which S-101 features can be combined to
create *Routeing Measure* features of each category. Note that line
features are used if not covered by an appropriate track/route feature,
or if information must be associated to the line that cannot be associated
to an area feature.

A suggested guide for deciding whether component S-101 features should
be combined is whether they are aggregated to the same (or related)
aggregate track/route features. E.g., combine TSS Lane Part and TSS
Roundabout features that are associated with the same
*TrafficS eparation Scheme* feature in the ENC via a "Traffic Separation
Scheme Aggregation" association. (*Traffic Separation Scheme* is an
aggregate feature in S-101 that does not have its own geometry.)

level is unknown, a null value can be given and any clarifying remarks
added to an associated *Nautical Information*.
* The International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code is
an amendment to the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention (1974/1988)
on minimum security arrangements for ships, ports and government agencies.
Having come into force in 2004, it prescribes responsibilities to
governments, shipping companies, shipboard personnel, and port/facility
personnel to "detect security threats and take preventative measures
against security incidents affecting ships or port facilities used
in international trade

==== Military practice areas (see S-4 -- B-441.1-6)

Military practice (or exercise) areas at sea are of various types
and may be classified as follows with regard to their significance
for the mariner:

* Firing danger areas, sometimes called firing practice areas, i.e.
permanent or temporary ranges, including bombing, torpedo, and missile
ranges.
* Mine-laying practice (and counter-measures) areas.
* Submarine exercise areas.
* Other exercise areas.

Some degree of restriction on navigation and other rights may be implied
by the encoding of military practice areas. There may be varying interpretations
of the validity of the restrictions and possible infringement of the
rights of innocent passage through territorial waters and elsewhere.
Where it is thought desirable to depict such areas, even though clear
range procedure may be observed, or the areas appear to be a derogation
of the freedom of the seas, mariners should be informed (not necessarily
on ENCs) that publication of the details of a law or regulation is
solely for the safety and convenience of shipping and implies no recognition
of the international validity of the law or regulation. By this means
infringements are not condoned but the mariner receives a warning
which may be necessary for their safety.

If it is required to encode a military practice area, it must be done
using the feature *Military Practice Area*.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Submarine exercise areas should generally not be encoded where submarines
exercise over wide areas which it would not be practicable to depict,
and over which cautions (to keep a good look out for them) are unlikely
to be effective. They may, however, be encoded where they occur in
or near major shipping lanes or port approaches.
* Firing danger areas at sea are frequently marked by IALA special
buoys sometimes laid around the
perimeter of the area and/or by specially erected lights, beacons,
and targets. If required, all such features which could assist the
navigator in identifying their position, or could be a hazard, must
be encoded in the normal way.

* The existence of mine-laying (and counter-measures/clearance) practice
areas implies the possibility of unexploded mines or depth charges
on the sea floor, and also the presence of harmless practice mines.

committed for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private
ship or a private aircraft, and directed:
.. on the high seas, against another ship or aircraft, or against
persons or property on board such ship or air-craft;
.. against a ship, aircraft, persons or property in a place outside
the jurisdiction of any State;

. any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship or
of an aircraft with knowledge of facts making it a pirate ship or
aircraft;
. any act of inciting or of intentionally facilitating an act described
in subparagraph (a) or (b).

(United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea -- Article 101)

Armed robbery takes place within the jurisdiction of a State.

If it is required to encode a place refuge for a ship or mariners,
it must be done using the feature class *Place of refuge*. If the
place of refuge is equipped with communication equipment, the VHF
communication channel can be described in the attribute *communicationChannel*.
Communication information for authorities located at other places
(or whose location is irrelevant or unknown) may be encoded in an
associated *Contact Details* object.

Where possible the full extent of the place of refuge area should
be encoded using surface geometry. When it is not possible to define
the area, point geometry can be placed in a central place of the area.

Authorities may designate any other location (port, harbour, a sheltered
place along the coastline, etc.) as a place of refuge for a specific
occurrence without designating it as a permanent or general place
of refuge. Such places should not normally be encoded as
*Place Of Refuge* features without consulting the responsible authority.

The relevant IMO circular and policies issued by maritime authorities
on places of refuge make it abundantly clear that designated places
are not the only possibilities for refuge, however, data producers
may, as a precaution, include general information about places of
refuge with their datasets. Such general information may be encoded
as a note advising mariners that other places of refuge may be arranged
for a particular incident with the consent of the appropriate authorities.
Such a note might be encoded as a *Nautical Information* object associated
to appropriate geographic features.

==== Vessel Traffic Service Area (see S-4 -- B-488.3)

A Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) is a service implemented by a competent
authority to improve the safety and efficiency of vessel traffic operations
and to protect the environment. A VTS provides, from one or more traffic
control centres, a number of services which may include:

* Traffic management for the safe and efficient movement of vessels
within the area, usually including mandatory reporting;
* Navigational assistance to support onboard decision making, usually
on request (see also S-4 B-487.2 for radar reference lines);
* Information for vessels operating in the area, for example: on arrival,
berthing, anchoring, and departure from ports; about movements of
other vessels; on navigational hazards; regarding weather. These may
be regularly broadcast or be available on request.
A VTS service area may range from supporting entry and departure to
an individual port to a much larger regional VTS (possibly containing
local VTS) that may provide services to vessels in the outer approaches
to ports or transiting through the region. Consequently, there may
be VTS within VTS and also overlapping VTS, making it difficult for
the mariner to always be aware which VTS area is applicable. Therefore,
wherever the information is available, limits of VTS areas should
be charted, at least on the largest scale chart and on appropriate
smaller scales where navigation is practicable and/or to assist passage
planning.

If it is required to encode a Vessel Traffic Service Area, it must
be done using the feature class *Vessel Traffic Service Area*.
The type of VTS is encoded in the *categoryOfVesselTrafficService*
attribute. If it is required to associate related Radio Calling-In
Points, Signal Stations (Warning or Traffic), or Radar Ranges this
must be done using the association _TrafficControlServiceAggregation_.

A ship reporting service may be operated by the VTS, and if it is
required to encoding an associated ship reporting service, this must
be done by encoding a *Ship Reporting Service Area* (see <<sec_5.25>>).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to describe the procedures for accessing the VTS
services, this must be done using the *serviceAccessProcedure* attribute.
* The requirements for maintaining listening watch within the VTS
area must be encoded in a summarized form using the
*requirementsForMaintenanceOfListeningWatch* attribute. Any detailed
elaborations should be encoded in the *textContent* attribute. As
a text attribute, this can be populated with the text "not specified",
"unknown", etc., if the requirements are unknown. If it is known that
there are no listening watch requirements, the attribute must be encoded
with "not applicable". (There may be a general requirement in the
applicable national shipping regulations instead of or in addition
to a specific requirement.)

==== Ship Reporting Service Area

IMO MSC 43(64) states that the objectives of a ship reporting system
should be based upon: "the improvement of the safety of life at sea,
the safety and efficiency of navigation and/or to increase the protection
of the marine environment. They may or may not be operated as part
of a vessel traffic service."As such, the Ship Reporting Service (SRS)
contributes to the traffic situational awareness of a Coastal administration
either by being informed of the ships heading into its waters or the
ones already transiting it. Based on the information collected, a
Coastal administration can initiate an intervention plan if required.
An SRS is generally regional in scale and may provide services to
vessels in the outer approaches to ports or transiting through the
region. Therefore, wherever the information is available, limits of
SRS areas should be charted, at least on the largest scale chart and
on appropriate smaller scales where navigation is practicable and/or
to assist passage planning. The service can range from providing information
and guidelines on reporting formalities and when, what and how to
report in a specific port to a full exchange of information in a Single
Window ship reporting system. A reportable area may also be encoded
as an Ship Reporting Service area.

If it is required to encode a Ship Reporting Service, it must be done
using the feature class *Ship Reporting Service Area*. If it is required
to associate related Radio Calling-In Points or VTS this must be done
using the association _TrafficControlServiceAggregation_.

If it is required to encode a Ship Reporting Service that is operated
by a VTS, this must be done by encoding coincident Ship Reporting
Service and VTS areas.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* If it is required to describe the procedures for accessing the SRS
services, this must be done using the *serviceAccessProcedure* attribute.
* The requirements for maintaining listening watch within the VTS
area must be encoded in a summarized form using the
*requirementsForMaintenanceOfListeningWatch* attribute. Any detailed
elaborations should be encoded in the *textContent* attribute.
As a text attribute, this can be populated with the text "not specified",
"unknown", etc., if the requirements are unknown. If it is known that
there are no listening watch requirements, the attribute must be encoded
with "not applicable".

==== Local Port Service Area

The Local Port Service (LPS) aims facilitating the exchange of information
and coordination among key stakeholders during each phase of a ship
transit. To promote an optimal coordination and efficient operations
all along the transportation chain, the exchange of information must
be done in a timely manner. This allows all actors involved in LPS
to take specific actions at the right moment either to respond or
to adapt to new situations, such as delay, premature departure/arrival,
incident, and so forth. A LPS cover an individual port and may provide
services to vessels in the outer approaches to the port or that are
transiting through the region. It may be difficult for the mariner
to always be aware which LPS area is applicable. Therefore, wherever
the information is available, limits of LPS areas should be charted,
at least on the largest scale chart and on appropriate smaller scales
where navigation is practicable and/or to assist passage planning.

If it is required to encode a Local Port Service Area, it must be
done using the feature class *Local Port Service Area*. If it is required
to associate related Radio Calling-In Points, Signal Stations
(Warning or Traffic), or Radar Ranges this must be done using the
association _TrafficControlServiceAggregation_.

[underline]#Remarks:#
