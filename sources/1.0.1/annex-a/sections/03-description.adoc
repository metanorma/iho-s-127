8+| [underline]#IHO Definition:# *FEATURE*: Definition.
(Authority for definition).

8+| *S-127 [Geo/Information] Feature: Feature (S-57 Acronym)* S-127
feature and corresponding S-57 acronym (if applicable)

8+| *[underline]#Primitives:#* Allowable geometric primitive(s) [*Point, Curve, Surface*]

3+a| _Real World_

Example if real world instance(s) of the Feature.

3+a| _Paper Chart Symbol_

Example(s) of paper chart equivalent symbology for the Feature (if applicable).

2+a| _ECDIS Symbol_

Example(s) of proposed ECDIS symbology for the Feature.

| This section lists the allowable attributes for the S-127 feature. This row is not used in this DCEG. Instead, the attributes are described by the picture below.
| 3+| | 2+|

8+| In the S-127 DCEG, the attributes are depicted by UML diagrams
showing the direct and inherited attributes for the feature or information
class, their complex attributes, and allowable encoding values for
enumeration attributes. In the example below, the *CautionArea* feature
has two direct attributes (condition and status, each with multiplicity
0 or 1). They are enumeration attributes, and the allowed values each
may take in a *CautionArea* feature are shown in the "enumeration"
boxes. The *CautionArea* feature also inherits five complex attributes
from the abstract class *FeatureType*; details of the inherited attributes
are not shown in the figure but can be seen in the feature table that
describes the *FeatureType* abstract feature.

The usual UML conventions apply. For explanations of standard UML
notations, see S-100 Part 1. For explanations of the colour conventions,
see clause 6.2 in the S-127 (Main) Product Specification.

| This sub-table is not used in this DCEG. Instead, the associations
are described by the picture below.
| | | | | | |

8+| In the S-127 DCEG, the associations are depicted by a UML diagram
showing the relationships that apply to the class and its super-classes
(generalizations). Relationships which are inherited from super-classes
are shown by including the super-classes and their associations in
the diagram. In the example below, *CautionArea* has no direct associations,
but inherits one feature association and three information associations
from the abstract class *FeatureType*.

Note that since the information type *AbstractRXN* is a super-class
of the four information types *Regulations*, *Restrictions*, *Recommendations*,
and *NauticalInformation* (see <<sec_7.2>>), the *AssociatedRxN* relationship
of *CautionArea* (or any other sub-class of *FeatureType*) applies
to those four classes.The usual UML conventions apply. For explanations
of standard UML notations, see S-100 Part 1. For explanations of the
conventions used for associations, see <<sec_2.5>> in this DCEG.

[underline]#INT 1 Reference:# The INT 1 location(s) of the
Feature -- by INT1 Section and Section Number (if applicable).

*X.X.X Sub-clause heading(s) (see S-4 -- B-YYY.Y)*

Introductory remarks. Includes information regarding the real world
entity/situation requiring the encoding of the Feature in the ENC,
and where required nautical cartographic principles relevant to the
Feature to aid the compiler in determining encoding requirements.

Specific instructions to encode the feature.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Additional encoding guidance relevant to the feature.

*X.X.X.X Sub-sub-clause heading(s) (see S-4 -- B-CCC.C)*

Clauses related to specific encoding scenarios for the Feature (if required).

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Additional encoding guidance relevant to the scenario (if required).

[underline]#Distinction:# List of features in the Product Specification
distinct from the Feature.

[underline]#Remarks:#

S-127 Attribute: Indentation of attributes indicates sub-attributes
of complex attributes. Complex attributes may also be sub-attributes
of complex attributes, which is indicated by further indentation of
the attribute name in the tables.

S-127 Attribute: Attributes shown in grey text are ECDIS "system"
attributes which are not visible to the encoder, but are populated
by the ENC production system in order to assist with portrayal of
ENC data in ECDIS.

S-57 Acronym: S-57 attribute acronyms shown in italic style text have
been re-modelled in S-101 from S-57.

Allowable Encoding Value: For (EN) type attributes, the enumerates
listed are only those allowable for the particular occurrence of the
attribute relevant to the feature. Allowable values may vary for the
attribute depending on the feature to which the attribute is bound.
Such bindings are defined in the S-127 Feature Catalogue. The full
list of enumerates that may be assigned to an attribute in S-127 can
be found in the Simple Attributes section of the printed feature catalogue
document.

Type: The prefix ++(C)++ indicates that the attribute is a complex
attribute. Complex attributes are aggregates of other attributes that
can be simple type or complex type (see Product Specification main
document clause 7.3). The prefix (S) indicates that the attribute
is a sub-attribute of a complex attribute. Complex attributes that
are sub-attributes of a complex attribute, and their sub-attributes,
are indicated by indentation of the attribute name in the S-127 Attribute
column.

Association ends and multiplicities: A lower bound of 0 in the multiplicity
at any end of an association indicates only that the association is
not mandatory for any particular instance of the feature at the other
end (i.e., it is not mandatory for an instance of "that" feature type
to have an association to a feature of "this" type). A lower bound
of "1" means that if an instance of "that" type exists, it must be
associated to an instance of "this" type. If the association is actually
encoded then it amounts to saying that "this relationship exists between
these two instances" and there must be an appropriate feature instance
at both ends. Associations that are not mandatory should be encoded
if and only if they convey useful information.
