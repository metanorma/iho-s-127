== Complex attributes

This DCEG describes complex attributes similarly to features and information
types, specifying the name, definition, etc., then providing a picture
depicting the sub-attributes and their types, then encoding remarks
describing any constraints, etc., that apply to the complex attribute
in general. Constraints and usage notes pertaining to their use in
specific features or information types are provided in the respective
table describing the feature or information type. Complex sub-attributes
are not shown in the figures since they are depicted in their own
sub-clauses elsewhere in this clause.
