== Cartographic Features

This product specification uses the *Text Placement* cartographic
features derived from S-101 (version 1.0). The structure of the feature
and its usage are the same as in S-101 but the feature specification
in S-127 omits elements which are not relevant to marine protected
areas, for example, 'light characteristic' is omitted as a listed
value for the attribute *text type*.

==== Text Placement
If it is required to place text to improve clarity of display, it
must be done using the cartographic feature *Text Placement*.
The *Text Placement* feature must be associated with the relevant
geo feature using the association _TextAssociation_.

[underline]#Remarks:#

* The *Text Placement* feature is used by the ECDIS to position the
associated text, which has been populated using an attribute(s) for
the related feature. This attribute is identified by populating the
attribute text type. Alternatively, the text to be displayed may be
encoded using the attribute text.
* Only one of the attributes text or text type is allowable for each
instance of *Text Placement*.
* *Text Placement* should only be associated with features of type
point, and used in areas where it is important that text clear navigationally
relevant areas, for example shipping channels and dredged areas.
