== Feature Catalogue

[[sec_7.1]]
=== Introduction

The Feature Catalogue describes the feature types, information types,
attributes, attribute values, associations and roles which may be
used in the product. The S-127 Feature Catalogue is available in an
XML document which conforms to the S-100 XML Feature Catalogue Schema
and can be downloaded from the IHO website (http://www.iho.int/).
Simple attributes used in this specification are listed in <<table_7.1>>
below.

=== Feature Types

Feature types contain descriptive attributes that characterize real-world
entities. The word 'feature' may be used in one of two senses -- feature
type and feature instance. A feature type is a class and is defined
in a Feature Catalogue. A feature instance is a single occurrence
of the feature type and represented as an object in a dataset. A feature
instance is located by a relationship to one or more spatial instances.
A feature instance may exist without referencing a spatial instance.

[[sec_7.2.1]]
==== Geographic

A geographic (Geo) feature type carries the descriptive characteristics
of a real-world entity.

[[sec_7.2.2]]
==== Meta

Meta features contain information about other features within a dataset.
Information defined by meta features override the default metadata
values defined by the dataset descriptive records. Meta attribution
on individual features overrides attribution on meta features.

[[sec_7.2.3]]
==== Cartographic

Cartographic features contain information about the cartographic representation
(including text) of real world entities.

[[sec_7.2.4]]
==== Feature relationship

A feature relationship links instances of one feature type with instances
of the same or a different feature type.

[[sec_7.2.5]]
==== Information Types

Information types are identifiable pieces of information in a dataset
that can be shared between other features. They have attributes but
have no relationship to any geometry; information types may reference
other information types.

[[sec_7.2.5.1]]
===== Spatial quality

Spatial quality attributes are carried in two information class called
Spatial Quality (for curves) and Spatial Quality Points (for points).
Currently no use case for associating surfaces with spatial quality
attributes has been identified, therefore this is prohibited.

[[sec_7.2.6]]
==== Attributes

S-127 defines attributes as either simple or complex.

[[sec_7.2.6.1]]
===== Simple attributes

The simple attribute value types used in S-127 are listed in <<table_7.1>>:

[[table_7.1]]
.Data types for simple attributes
[cols="2"]
|===
h| Type h| Definition

| Enumeration | A fixed list of valid identifiers of named literal values
| Boolean
| A value representing binary logic. The value can be either True
or False. The default state for Boolean type attributes (i.e. where
the attribute is not populated for the feature) is False.
| Real | A signed Real (floating point) number consisting of a mantissa
and an exponent
| Integer
| A signed integer number. The representation of an integer is encapsulation
and usage dependent.
| CharacterString or Text footnote:[Simple attributes in feature and
information types use _Text_; metadata attributes use _CharacterString_.]

| An arbitrary-length sequence of characters including accents and
special characters from a repertoire of one of the adopted character
sets.
| Date footnote:note_seven_one[The _Date_ and _URI_ types are not
used in S-127 1.0.x0, but are described because they are referenced
by other types.]

a| A date provides values for year, month and day according to the
Gregorian Calendar. Character encoding of a date is a string which
must follow the calendar date format (complete representation, basic
format) for date specified by <<ISO_8601_2004>>.

[example]
19980918 (YYYY-MM-DD)

| Time
a| A time is given by an hour, minute and second. Character encoding
of a time is a string that follows the local time (complete representation,
basic format) format defined in <<ISO_8601_2004>>.

[example]
183059 or 183059+0100 or 183059Z

| Codelist | A type of flexible enumeration. A code list type is a
list of literals which may be extended only in conformance with specified
rules.
| Truncated date | One or more components of the Date type are omitted.
| URI footnote:note_seven_one[]

a| A uniform resource identifier as defined in RFC 3986. Character
encodingof a URI shall follow the syntax rules defined in RFC 3986.

[example]
http://registry.iho.int

| URL
a| A uniform resource locator (URL) is a URI that provides a means
oflocating the resource by describing its primary access mechanism
(RFC3986).

[example]
http://registry.iho.int

=== Complex attributes

Complex attributes are aggregations of other attributes that are either
simple or complex. The aggregation is defined by means of attribute
bindings.

=== Units of measure

The following units of measure is used in Marine Traffic Management
datasets;

* Orientation is given in decimal degrees
* Radio frequency is given in hertz
* Uncertainty is given in metres
* Distances are given in metres or nautical miles
* Depths are given in metres.

[[sec_7.5]]
=== Geometric representation

Geometric representation is the digital description of the spatial
component of an object as described in S-100 and <<ISO_19107_2003>>. This product
specification uses three types of geometries: GM_Point, GM_OrientableCurve,
and GM_OrientableSurface.
