== Specification description

[[sec_4.1]]
=== Informal description of data product

This clause contains general information about the data product.

*Title:*:: Marine Traffic Management Product Specification.

*Abstract:*:: Marine Traffic Management (MTM) datasets describe the
availability and reliability of vessel traffic services, pilotage,
routing measures, and ship reporting systems. This includes their
service areas, services offered, and instructions for contacting or
utilizing these services. MTM is intended to be a supplement to ENC,
and therefore does not describe the geographic information in detail
equal to ENC, rather it is shown as a simplified geometry to indicate
location, and to be a means of geolocating more regulatory information
than the typical ENC.

*Content:*:: Datasets conforming to this specification will contain
all relevant MTM information for the area of coverage. Additionally,
there will be relevant metadata data quality, production authority,
data sources, and publication date.

*Spatial Extent:*:: Global coverage of maritime areas.

*Specific Purpose:*:: Describing traffic management in the maritime
domain for utilization in ECDIS, and to allow the producer to exchange
marine traffic management information with interested stakeholders.

[[sec_4.3.1]]
==== Introduction

Changes to S-127 will be released by the IHO as a new edition, a revision,
or as a document that includes clarification. These are described
below.

[[sec_4.3.2]]
==== New edition

New Editions introduce significant changes. New Editions enable new
concepts, such as the ability to support new functions or applications,
or the introduction of new constructs or data types. New Editions
are likely to have a significant impact on either existing users or
future users of S-127.

[[sec_4.3.3]]
==== Revisions

Revisions are defined as substantive semantic changes. Typically,
revisions will introduce change to correct factual errors; introduce
necessary changes that have become evident as a result of practical
experience or changing circumstances. A revision must not be classified
as a clarification. Revisions could have an impact on either existing
users or future users of this specification. All cumulative clarifications
will be included with the release of approved corrections revisions.

Changes in a revision are minor and ensure backward compatibility
with the previous versions within the same Edition. Newer revisions,
for example, introduce new features and attributes. Within the same
Edition, a dataset of one version could always be processed with a
later version of the feature and portrayal catalogues. In most cases
a new feature or portrayal catalogue will result in a revision of
this specification.

[[sec_4.3.4]]
==== Clarification

Clarifications are non-substantive changes. Typically, clarifications:
remove ambiguity; correct spelling, punctuation, or grammar errors;
amend or update cross references; insert improved graphics. Clarification
must not cause any substantive semantic changes.

Changes in a clarification are minor and ensure backward compatibility
with the previous versions within the same Edition. Within the same
Edition, a dataset of one clarification version could always be processed
with a later version of the feature and portrayal catalogues, and
a portrayal catalogue can always rely on earlier versions of the feature
catalogues.

Changes in a clarification are minor and ensure backward compatibility
with the previous versions.

[[sec_4.3.5]]
==== Version numbers

The associated version control numbering to identify changes (n) to
this specification must be as follows:

New Editions denoted as *n*.0.0

Revisions denoted as n.*n*.0

Clarifications denoted as n.n.*n*

[[sec_4.4]]
=== Specification scope

This product specification describes one data product and therefore
requires only one scope which is described below:

*Scope ID:*:: Marine Traffic Management datasets.

*Hierarchical level:*:: MD_ScopeCode - 005 (dataset)

*Hierarchical level name:*:: MTM dataset

*Level description:*:: information applies to the dataset

*Extent:*:: EX_Extent.description: Global coverage of maritime areas
