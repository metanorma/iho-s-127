== Portrayal

Portrayal is not defined in this version of S-127 Marine Traffic Management
Product Specifications. Users are free to choose the means and methodology
of portrayal as they see best suited for their needs. It should be
noted that future versions of S-127 may include a portrayal catalogue,
and any implementer should therefore anticipate this, and make sufficient
provisions in any system supporting S-127.
